## Standards

* [CybOX](https://cyboxproject.github.io/) - The Cyber Observable eXpression (CybOX) language provides a common structure for representing cyber observables across and among the operational areas of enterprise cyber security that improves the consistency, efficiency, and interoperability of deployed tools and processes, as well as increases overall situational awareness by enabling the potential for detailed automatable sharing, mapping, detection, and analysis heuristics.
* [STIX](http://stixproject.github.io/) - The Structured Threat Information eXpression (STIX) language is a standardized construct to represent cyber threat information. 
The STIX Language intends to convey the full range of potential cyber threat information and strives to be fully expressive, flexible, extensible, and automatable. 
* [TAXII](http://taxiiproject.github.io/) - The Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII) standard defines a set of services and message exchanges that, when implemented,  enable sharing of actionable cyber threat information across organization and product/service boundaries. 
TAXII defines concepts, protocols, and message exchanges to exchange cyber threat information for the detection, prevention, and mitigation of cyber threats.
